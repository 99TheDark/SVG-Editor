To-Do:
Dragging points of ellipse/rectangle increase size
Dragging points on shape while holding shift does from center
Dragging points on shape while holding alt does in all directions equaly
Clicking keeps selection box and nodes showing
Color selection works
Add text boxes with RGB, HSV, HEX, etc inputs (that update to the current color when color is changed)
Stroke color and stroke size
Opacity option for colors
Make a different color dot or some sort of indicator appear when the mouse is near the edges of a rectangle (so basically inside rect+boundry/2 and not inside rect-boundry/2), same idea with ellipse
When mouse down and near edge turn rect to polygon
Add the line
Undo/Redo
Add lots of dropdown shadows
Light & Dark mode

Bugs:
Mouse hovers over text and interacts with stuff when dragging around svg elements offscreen
