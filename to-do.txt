To-Do:
Dragging points on shape while holding shift does from center - WIP
Dragging points on shape while holding alt does in all directions equaly
Clicking keeps selection box and nodes showing
Color selection works
Add text boxes with RGB, HSV, HEX, etc inputs (that update to the current color when color is changed)
Stroke color and stroke size
Opacity option for colors
Make a different color dot or some sort of indicator appear when the mouse is near the edges of a rectangle (so basically inside rect+boundry/2 and not inside rect-boundry/2), same idea with ellipse
When mouse down and near edge turn rect to polygon
Add the line
Undo/Redo
Make ellipse resizing easier (recalculate center) - maybe while holding shift?
Delete objects
Copy + paste objects
Dashed lines when selecting object and not mouse down/moving it (<path stroke-dasharray="14, 12" d="M 5 40 l 215 0"/>) M = move to, l = line
Add groups (<g>)
Replace font with something less curvy and cartoony

Bugs:
Resizing to "negatives" modes center point slightly in the one frame
